Since then, our JS community has grown tremendously. And this year, we’re meeting again on 26 – 27 October to explore new ideas and developments, to implement innovative solutions, and to learn from others’ experiences. Want to see the quality and topics of talks at last year’s conference? You can watch the JSFoo 2017 videos or the related ReactFoo 2017 videos to see what was on trend.

The format includes meetups, panels, and conferences, and always a pub after each event.For seven years, we've had regular JavaScript meetup events. And then we spend time discussing JavaScript at a pub and/or CodeNode. For the fourth time, we're flipping this around and bringing the talks to a pub in the Shoreditch area.Talks will include a variety of modern front-end development topics (2017's conference covered ES6, TypeScript, frameworks, WebGL, web audio/video, WebVR, speech recognition, JS poetry, and much more) from leading speakers based primarily in London. The Call for Papers will be open from March through mid July. We will let all potential speakers know our answer by mid-August.
