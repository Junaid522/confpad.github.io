    Components are hot. Every view library or framework seems to be based on components these days. But when you write your React component you can't share it with an Angular developer. Your Vue components can't be used in Preact. The result: fragmentation. The cost: reinventing the wheel for every library. We've had the answer for years, though. Web components are the standards based solution, but they've never seemed ready for the big time. Until now. In this talk we'll look at why 2018 is finally the year of web components, the tools and libraries that we can use to build with web components and how you can get started building shareable, compatible, standards based components.

    CSS is hard !I made a living out of it being hard but when React was introduced we had a whole new level of fighting over CSS, there are so many ways to approach it and so many tradeoffs one can do when choosing the better approach that a talk that will go over these options is more than necessary. Let's walk this road thogheter and I promise it will all be fine and you will leave with an ideia of type of styling is better for each project. Hint: There is no perfect way ....

    This past year, I released React Final Form, a next generation form library for React, based on everything I had learned from managing React's most popular form library, Redux Form. My talk will explain the decisions made in designing this new library as well as an explanation of how to build some common types of forms.

    Teams today are facing similar problems: How do we encourage the reuse of existing components? How do we raise awareness for them? How do we keep them stable while keeping maintenance efforts low? How do we ensure a coherent branding without exploiting our designers? If you are worried by these questions fear no longer. I aim to show you a way out of this self-made jungle into a brighter world of coded style guides. We will explore together how we can tear down walls between design and development and how everyone can benefit from introducing living component directories into their project.

    We come from a time where javascript was kept in different files, loading them in the right order in the html. Module loaders came to life, RequireJS and Browserify being the first of them. Webpack and Rollup followed them, which are truly amazing. But... have you ever configured them for a real-world app? New tools started to appear tagged as zero-config tools: Parcel, Poi, Microbundle, Rollit... What's the deal with this zero-config trend? This talk dives deep in this zero-config evolution, explaining its reasons and benefits.

    React’s sophisticated reconciler (aka the “Virtual DOM”) makes updates to the UI feel fast because it optimizes interactions with the DOM. As a result, we no longer have to worry about how to transition our UI from one state to the next. However, the reconciler is not a silver bullet; even the new Fiber Reconciler. Our React apps can still get sluggish, especially as they grow in size and data. Let’s discuss some causes for slow-downs and tools to diagnose problems so that we can speed up our apps.

    In this talk, we'll go through the journey of building a fully fledged Music Player using React Native. Given the player specifications, we were challenged to prove that React Native has no limits when it comes to build mobile applications, no matter how complex they are and having performance and cross-platform in mind. We’ll break down the player architecture, covering the different approaches to the problem (Declarative vs Imperative), as well as unveiling all the player elements in a top-down fashion, starting with the music service and the score visualisation and moving further along to smaller pieces such as time progress, progress bar, seeking and replay.

    This talk will cover one of the open questions of modern development: when a pattern is a pattern? how do we reuse one in a slightly different use case? Not a recipe for success, more of a way to frame the problem, identify some ideas we tried and rediscuss the way we approach componentisation

    The obsession to always move on to the latest and greatest, and the fear of missing out while working with something that's older than few months is currently dominating the dev world. In my previous talks, I always included a short bit about this topic.
