The type system is immensely helpful, but what if we make some sacrifices to widen the scope of use cases, would that be possible?\n\nThe answer is yes. We can use the GraphQL query parser, coupled with some other data provided by the user to construct expressive data driven components using any backend utilizing tools that already exist in the GraphQL community."

In the world of visualization research mark-based visualization systems such as Vega are common, but can be problematic to integrate into applications. In this talk we introduce a grammar-of-graphics based library based on Vega's abstraction, but designed to work well with React and React-Native using a renderless component pattern."
