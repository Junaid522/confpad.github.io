    Systems and products that have the most influence on the world today tend to have the least presence. What tools can we use to make their intangibility and intensely unhuman scale more human and tangible? We'll look at book design, how designers of the 20th century have tackled this problem, and how meditative practices such as vipasanna and walking are useful tools in the contemporary human toolkit.

    How do you know what consumers expect from your site? Every shopper is different and every shopping visit is different. Industry stats tell only part of the story. You need to crack the hood and analyze your own real user data.

    It’s time to accept that system and network failures are inevitable and to start designing our systems to withstand them. Accomplishing this isn’t easy but we’ve learnt a few tricks along the way which we would love to share!

    Every decision we make is one made on behalf of your user. How do we know the decisions we make are the right ones? It is time we initiate a conversation: About where we are and where we want to go, about how we define and measure goodness and rightness in the digital realm, about responsibility, about decisions and consequences, about building something bigger than our own apps. It is time we talk about the ethics of design.

    We have a complex love-hate relationship with the third-party content on our sites, and it has taken a turn for the worse. On the one hand, third-party content often pays the bills. On the other hand, recent developments have increased its “cost.” HTTP/2 means third-party content is even more of a performance burden than before; the weight of that content is taking up an ever larger percentage of our site’s overall bytesize; ad-blockers mean users have had enough; and projects like Google AMP and Facebook Instant Articles mean that embedders feel the same. Our lack of control over what third parties are doing on our sites is showing. How can we gain it back?

    to designing with words. Great UX writing isn't a fill-in-the-blanks approach,
    but a strategy and creative process, just like design and product development.
